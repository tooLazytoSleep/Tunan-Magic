: During my internship, the company began to prepare to establish its own official website. Since the company is a company specializing in artificial intelligence research, there are no dedicated web engineers in the company. Thus, I volunteered to be responsible for the construction of this website because I have work experience in this area.
Main work: Website functional structure design and website programming using native HTML, CSS and JS for the front-end part because the interaction of website is not complex, and using Spring framework which is the popular framework for the server part.
1.	Design a UML functional structure for the website including front-end part and server part.
2. 	Communicate with UI designers and design the website together.
3.	Programming for the web using native HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery library.
4.	When finished most of part of front-end part, communicate with server engineer and achieve interaction of front-end and server with database using Mysql.
